"\n  Please don't buy it."", ""It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know"", ' from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.', 'You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max.\n'",,
"\n  Actually asusual best phone by redmi.Amazing phone design with best quality camera. Very excellent built quality. It comes with 33w fast charging which is really fast.', 'But I wish it would have 90hz refresh rate.\n'",,
"\n  Product performance is poor.', 'Its speed is like 2 GB RAM mobile.', 'Processor is too slow feels like very old mobiles.', 'Battery drains very fast.', 'Worst mobile performance.', 'Not even like Redmi Note 4.', 'Waste of money. 17000 is too much price for such poor performance.', 'I think worst product from Xiaomi RedMi.', 'Samsung M31 is far better in performance and battery.\n'",,

"\n  guys beware wifi doesn't work when you lock your phone for 10min. again when u unlock it it works. seriously issue.  redmi should work upon\n""",,
"\n  Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.\n""",,
"\n  Not satisfied with product', 'Since we use redmi mobile brand in my family even base varaint sounds good performance after 2years when am using this for first time. Dis appointment on purchasing this.', ""I tired to record voice from this mobile around 1pm and sound was good. I thought wow such a nice but after 30min . Very aloud recorded voice was under ground the earth. Later I compares recording with redmi 5A andRedmi note 4 and this phone but I couldn't hear anything in redmi note 9pro max. How come within few minutes this change happening in 3hrs useage of mobile in the first day.  Soon charge drains without useage ,What will b future then?\n""",,
